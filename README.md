### About
The PUPian Maze is a web application game where users guide a character named Isko through a maze to reach PUP. The maze is generated using the backtracking algorithm, which ensures a complex and unique structure each time. To aid users, the A* algorithm is employed to highlight the optimal path through the maze. Players must navigate the maze, overcoming obstacles and making strategic decisions, to successfully bring Isko to his destination.
